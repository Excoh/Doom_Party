# Doom_Party

## Submitting changes / Contributing
Create your own branch, name it something specific to the feature. (i.e. enemy_ai)

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Doom_Party](https://github.com/GDCASU/Doom_Party/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done. Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
